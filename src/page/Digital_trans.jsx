            business models.

          <p>
            SAP's core vision has always been to help businesses win through
            innovation. RISE with SAP is a landmark offering designed to
            accelerate this vision by helping enterprises rethink their approach
            to digital transformation—not by replacing systems, but by
            realigning them for agility, intelligence, and scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            A robust ERP core is the foundation of digital resilience. With RISE
            with SAP in a Private Cloud, organizations can retain control,
            customization, and compliance, while embracing the flexibility and
            speed of the cloud.
